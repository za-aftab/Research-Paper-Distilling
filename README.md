# Research-Paper-Distilling

## Overview
Research paper distilling is a valuable skill as the ability to identify and summarise key information from complex papers and presenting them in a simplified format is essential to effectively communicate methodologies and research findings to audiences in a short amount of time. During the course "Text Mining" I successfully acquired this skill. 

## Assignment 
The objective was to review a research paper and design a poster showcasing its key information. Later on, the poster was presented to the other course participants. I choose the research paper "Detecting Depression in Social Media using Fine-Grained Emotions" by Mario Ezra Arag칩n, A. Pastor L칩pez-Monroy, Luis C. Gonz치lez-Gurrola, Manuel Montes-y-G칩mez. 

(Note: The chosen paper had to comply with the guidelines set by the professor.)
